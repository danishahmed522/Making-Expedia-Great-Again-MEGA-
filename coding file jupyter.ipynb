    "This in-depth investigation necessitated us to utilize variables such as the number of adults (*adult_count*), children (*child_count*), and infants (*infant_count*). Additionally, we used star ratings(*star_rating1*), number of reviews (*review_count1*), price bucket (*price_bucket1*) and whether a listing is discounted or not (*is_drr1*).\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the average number of reviews generated for discounted and non-discounted listings? How well does star rating and review count predict the price of a listing?  What is the majority consumer base of Expedia? These are some of the questions we hope to answer.\n",

    "### Q1\n",
    "-   During this period, the travel industry was extraordinarily impacted by the outbreak of Covid-19; hence, the data given to us is not archetypal (of the pre-pandemic era) as innumerable people would not risk going out with their children in such circumstances.\\\n",
    "-  There is also a probability of having a Type 2 error as we have accepted the null hypothesis. This insinuates that it is reasonably possible for the alternative hypothesis to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2\n",
    "-\tThe thresholds set for a low price and a high price are arbitrarily determined. Possibly, what customers consider expensive and what we perceive they appraise expensive are quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tThe low sensitivity may lead to price-sensitive customers not booking listings because they recognize that the so-called disernible low prices are actually high. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations (Cont.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3\n",
    "\n",
    "-   There is a possibility that we might make a Type 1 error i.e.,it is plausible that the mean number of reviews for both discounted and undiscounted listings are the same despite our pronouncement to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Furthermore, there may be occurrences where a listing with a high number of reviews may also encompass a considerable number of substandard and poor feedback from the customers. Hence, it might not be an excellent decision to show such listings on the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Though we have deduced that the mean number of reviews is not equal between discounted and non-discounted listings through the p-value, it is arduous to figure out the actual reason why they are not equal through this statistical approach. Perhaps, there may be numerous other factors that can remarkably influence the number of reviews including customer services, amenities available at the respective listing including parking, swimming pool etc. and more."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For Q1, after the research, we were able to ratify and corroborate that the consumer base of Expedia majorly comprises of the people who travel without juveniles. Through this information, Expedia should now utilize price discriminating strategies on clientele groups like couples; consequently, increasing their overall sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For Q2, the addition of filters can help proliferate the number of purchases for Expedia. Price-sensitive customers can be guided to listings suitable to their preferences who did not have the option of using these filters. In the investigation, we ascertained that the patrons may not have booked a listing because they could not find a suitable price in the recommendations given to them. This is a loss for Expedia and the consumer as a result of insufficient website maneuverability.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For Q3, we conclude that it is indispensable for Expedia to give out more discounts to increase the number of sales (from Q1 through price discrimination strategies), thus increasing the number of reviews. A research study has demonstrated that 67% of the consumers are eager to write a review if they are proffered a discount on a stipulated good or a service (Pitman, 2022). \n"
